 **SimpleRes** is a lightweight python app utilising the System Tray and win32 api to change your resolution 

>‚ö†Ô∏è Currently this only works for **Windows**

## Get started 
### First Clone or Download the repository

    pip install pystray
    pip install PILLOW
	pip install pywin32

    install.bat

## But why?
I play a fair amount of counter strike, Aprox 1500 hours and in counter strike there is a glitch when alt tabbing on streched resolution set by the **game** it resets back to what your current **computer** resolution is and this is very annoying. instead of opening *NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL* and changing my resolution every single time i want to play i can now use SimpleRes. this also goes for other games such as Fortnite, Valorant, ect which ive had issues in the past before with, especially Fortnite.

## Conclusion
